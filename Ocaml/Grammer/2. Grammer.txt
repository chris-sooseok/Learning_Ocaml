(* Syntax vs Semantics *)
- Syntax if about form and semantics about meaning

We have two kinds of semantics: static and dynamic


(* Semantics: Static vs Dynamic *)
Static
- Set of rules to the syntactic structure. Ex. typing information, well-formedness of commands
- Usually enforced statically (before execution)

Dynamic
- Set of rules to how syntactic objects need to be executed. Ex. expression evaluation, commands execution
- How the program must be executed at runtime


(* Stntactic Structure of Programming Languages *)
1. The scanning phase collects characters into tokens (words)
2. Parsing phase (syntatic analyzer) determines the validity of grammer sentences


(* Formal language : BNF (Backus Normal/Naur Form) or Context-free grammars *)

 BNF grammar is defined by a set of terminals (tokens), a set of nonterminals, an initial nonterminal symbol, 
 and a finite nonempty set of rules
