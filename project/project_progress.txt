Tip for interpreter part2

Think the stack as the list of values
Ocaml requires nested let for binding, but the interpreter has let ... end which allows
mutiple bindings within it.

- now stack as a list list stack
- add environment to your processor
- we are implementing static scoping rules
- using let gives you a new scope
- let end is like {}
